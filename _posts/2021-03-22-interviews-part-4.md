When discussing technical interviews at Silicon Valley style companies, several question often come up - why do those interviews have to be so hard? Or alternatively - why do those interviews have to be so long? 

While I have not been designing this interview process, I have been following such processes long enough as an interviewer to have some idea as to what they are trying to achieve. 

It boils down to several things:
* We want to hire only the candidates that meet our (high) quality bar. 
* We want to differentiate between different engineering levels
* We want to be as fair and unbiased as possible

The interview process is designed to address these requirements. 

Let's talk about bias and fairness first. All interviewers usually have to complete some basic traiing, which always includes anti-bias training. In addition to that often there are multiple interview steps, that allow candidates to demonstrate the same skill - for example solving problems by writing a program to solve them. While this may seem redundant, it's there mostly for the benefit of the candidate - if you've got unlucky with one problem (or perhaps one interviewer) - you get a second chance to demonsttrate that skill. While that prolongs the interview, it's actually beneficial to the candidate. Also, as the candidate gets to demosntrate his various skills to multiple different people, who then meet and try to come to a decision on whether this particular candidate meets our needs, every interviewer has to present concrete arguments on both a yes and a no. If anyone would try to bring something like "we didn't wibe well" to a debrief, such argument wouldn't fly. This collective debreifing also allows us to remove some of the biases from the process.

An equally important reason for having long and hard interviews is giving the candidate the ability how good they really are. If everyone got a simple asignment, that anyone can solve perfectly, what information does that give us? How could the great candidates stand out among the good ones? Or the good ones among the mediocre ones? This is the reason for multi-faceted, hard interviews. So when you receive a hard question during your next interview, take some pride in it - that means and interviewer thinks there's a chance you could solve it at least partially and demonstrate how good you are.

And what if you don't solve all the questions? Well, that's where levels come into play.  Don't worry, that might be the expected result for your target level.
