Interviews and interviewing is always a hot and sometimes controversial topic. Most people find it annoying, but let me tell you, why you should enjoy the interviews and try to do them often!

I know that there are already dozens of great articles online about interviewing in general and interviewing for technical positions in particular. Still, there are so many candidates, who come unprepared (or people who don't come at all, because they're afraid), that I want to write this, in hopes that it can help more people succeed!

## Interviewing is the only way to get hired
If you want to get a new job (and you should be in general open to new opportunities, unless you've just joined your current company AND you're loving it), the reality is, that you have to interview. There's no other way around it. Sure, sometimes your old friend from college will just offer you a job because he/she likes you, but these don't happen often and they never happen at top companies - regardless of how much someone adores your skills and experience - you'll have to demonstrate those during the interview process first. So, interviews are inevitable, unless you're planning to retire with your current employer (or stay jobless, when your current employer lays you off). So, if you'll have to do them, why not do them well? (and perhaps enjoy them just a little bit?)
 
## Interviewing is a way to get to know the world around you
Even if you would not change your job for any other, interviewing is still useful beyond just practicing your skills. It's a way to know more about what companies are looking for talent in your area. For what kind of work. What skills are they looking for? There's also no better way to know how their interview process looks like. And in addition to all this - you don't know how much someone is willing to pay for your work unless you have an offer on the table. The offer is twice what you earn today? Maybe it's time to move. No one is willing to pay more than half of what you're earning right now? Feel more grateful for what you have. You win either way.
 
## Interviewing is a way to get your skills validated
Once you (finally) get an offer from your dream company, even if you decide to not take it, you'll know, that you've proved to them, that you're great. If you always knew that you're the best - congratulations, that wasn't megalomania. If, as it's often the case, you're suffering from imposter syndrome - well, if someone is giving you a job offer after a hard and long interview process - perhaps you're quite good at what you do after all.
 
If you get rejected, that can be a great reality check. Perhaps you're not AS good as you were thinking. Perhaps you didn't spend enough time preparing. Before I got my first offer from a top tech company (Uber), I was rejected by Amazon more than once. It's because of these failures at Amazon, that I was able to pass the interview at Uber - I got familiar with the interview process, I got a reality check about my skills, and knew that whatever I do daily is not enough - and so I have to prepare.
 
## Please, do apply
Some people decide to not apply to positions, that they don't think they're good enough for. While this may be true, don't be your own judge - the cost of applying is usually quite low (how hard is it to send your CV?). If you were right - you lose nothing, but if you get invited to an interview - maybe you were wrong. As per the previous section, even if it doesn't go well during the interview day, you can still learn valuable lessons in the process and improve your chances next time.
 
So regardless of how it goes on the interview day, please go and interview!

What about you? Are you afraid of interviews? Do you manage to enjoy them, or are they pure stress?
