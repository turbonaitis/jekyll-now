In [part 1]({% post_url 2020-10-01-interviews-part-1 %}) I've covered why you have to interview and why it's a good idea to do them more often. Now, let me write a little bit on why preparing for the interview is essential and (a tiny bit) on how to do it.

## Interviewing is a skill
You might be at the top of your profession, but unless you're also a celebrity - your employer-to-be does not know that. The interview process is there so that you can showcase your skills and experience and prove that you're indeed the best candidate to get the job done. Demonstrating that experience and skill is very different from actually performing the work, especially for people who are in professions, where you don't necessarily have to talk to humans daily. Even if you're in sales, selling yourself might be very different from selling whatever you're selling daily.
 
### Practice it!
Like any other skill, to be good at interviewing, you have to practice it. The practicing bit comes in two parts:
* You have to go to the actual interviews. If you haven't been in an interview for 5 years, chances are you are not going to shine there.
* Before you go to an actual interview, if you want to have higher chances of success - you have to practice before it.
 
As an interviewer, I see a lot of people fail during the interview day simply because they're not prepared - they don't know what questions to expect, how to answer those questions, or even what the interviewer is expecting from them. This usually leads to a lot of stress to the candidate and when you combine all these things - the interview rarely ends well.
 
That's why it's very important to come prepared for all of this.

### What questions can one expect?
A lot of big companies send the candidate a preparation email, which outlines what questions to expect. Read them carefully. Even if there's no such email - google "Company X interview questions for my profession" or "top interview questions for the profession". You'll be surprised how much info is on the internet, despite all the NDAs. Of course, most likely you won't get THAT question during your interview (and if you do get a question you know - it's probably best to tell that to your interviewer straight away - if they're calibrated - they'll know, that you've solved this problem recently). Despite that, you'll know what topics to expect and won't be caught off-guard. This also applies to the soft-skill interviews! 

### How to answer these questions?
Now, that you know how the questions will look like, you have to get yourself ready to give the answers! For technical problems - practice makes perfect. If you're a developer - go to leetcode.com or hackerrank.com and you'll find many problems, easy and hard, waiting to be solved. If you got a preparation email from your recruiter, it quite often contains preparation material as well.

Start with the easy ones, but if you're aiming for a senior position - you have to be able to crack the hard ones as well. If the hard ones seem impossible - read about the topic and the problem and more than likely you'll find a way to solve them. If the easy ones seem too easy for you - focus on speed and accuracy. Aim to create a working solution on your first try as soon as possible. 

Speaking of time, it's always a good idea to keep track of how long you're taking to solve a given problem. It's great, that you're creating a perfect solution, but if it takes 4 hours to complete it - the interview will be long over before you even get started. Not all problems in these online sites are solvable within an hour (or whatever is the length of a single interview round in the company you're applying to), but you should be able to solve MOST of them in time, suitable for an interview. If you can't - well, try to analyse where you're spending the most time - is it understanding the question, identifying a solution, writing the actual code, or perhaps debugging it. All of these can be addressed differently.

You have to practice the soft questions too! If you think you'll get questions like "Tell me about a time when you did X", you can improve your chances significantly by thinking of several examples in advance. Then ask a friend to ask you those questions. If you film the process and then watch it - that's even better. (in absence of a friend, simply talking to a camera works too, although it's a bit more awkward)

 The best part about preparation for a technical interview - even if you don't get the job, you'll still learn new things (or at least renew your forgotten knowledge) in the process. 

### What does the person on the other side of the table want from me? 
Try to understand what the interviewer is expecting from you. For example, during the coding interviews, some companies (or even some interviewers) demand working, compilable code first and foremost and only then want to go into optimizations, while others are fine with pseudo-code and focus more on demonstrating the knowledge of algorithms and datastructures to create an optimal solution. Sometimes this information is provided to you by the recruitment team in advance, but if you do have any doubts - it's best to ask your interviewer. In general, the ability to ask questions (and to incorporate the answers in your solution!) is something that is desired of all candidates - so it's ALWAYS better to ask than to assume. If you chose to assume something - state that assumption explicitly. Be vocal in general about what you're doing - this way, the interviewer can see your intentions better and thus if you're doing something that does not match their expectations, they can give you feedback early on.

In general, 99% of interviewers are well intended - they want you to show your best self and succeed (the remaining 1% should not be allowed anywhere close to the candidates). Use that to your own advantage and try to collaborate with them.

### The interview stress
Everyone is at least a little bit stressed during an interview and a little stress is good for us - it gets us focused. Too much stress though can destroy your performance and that's why you need to learn to stress as little as you can. Stress management is a wide topic, which I'm unable to cover here, but during your interview, know that the interviewers are well intended and that you already did all you can preparing for this interview. Now is not the time to stress, now is the time to do your best :) 

## Schedule your interviews in a smart way
The list of things to go through, when you're preparing for an interview is a bit long - that's why you should schedule your interviews in a smart way to give yourself enough time to prepare, but also to use those skills well. 

Here's what you should do:
* Schedule several interviews in the same period. Not only will this allow you to prepare once and then interview several times while still fresh, but this will also allow you to get a much better deal in the end. You can compare several offers, pit them against each other, and have a better feeling, which offer is good. Negotiation though is a topic for another time.
* Try to interview more often - closer to once a year than once a decade. This helps you keep your interviewing skills fresh (so you'll have to spend less time preparing) and also will make interviews feel more normal - by which I mean much less stressful.
 
How are you preparing for your interviews? Have I missed anything? Is there any interviewing topic that you'd like me to write about in the future?
