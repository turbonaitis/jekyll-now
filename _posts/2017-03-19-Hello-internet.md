Hello, internet!
After thinking of starting blogging (again) for a while, I've finally decided to dedicate time to actually doing it.

Probably the main reason, why it took me so long to get to it (apart from the standard "I don't have time for this"), was my last attempt at blogging - I only wrote one or two posts there and then it died. Today though I have a healthy backlog of blogging ideas, so there's a real chance, that this attempt will be different!

So, what will I be blogging about?
- .NET/c#
- AWS/cloud computing
- Startup life
- Software architecture
- Continuous integration/delivery
- Software architecture patterns
- Agile practices

Although the list above represents what is currently in my blogging backlog and the future might bring in other topics, this should give the general idea of what this will be about.

Please subscribe to the RSS feed (the icon in the page footer) - I'll try to post around once per week, so RSS is the best way not to miss my posts.
