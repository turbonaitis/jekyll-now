When discussing technical interviews at Silicon Valley style companies, several question often come up - why do those interviews have to be so hard? Or alternatively - why do those interviews have to be so long? 

While I have not been designing this interview process, I have been following such processes long enough as an interviewer to have some idea as to what they are trying to achieve. 

It boils down to several things:
* We want to hire only the candidates that meet our (high) quality bar. 
* We want to differentiate between different engineering levels
* We want to be as fair and unbiased as possible

The interview process is designed to address these requirements. 

Let's talk about bias and fairness first. To counter the inherent biases that we all have, all interviewers usually have to complete some anti-bias training before they're allowed to interview people. 

More importantly, the process itself is designed to remove as much bias by any single interviewer as possible. Multiple interview steps that test the same skill (programming for example) are there precisely for that reason. While it may seem redundant, it's there mostly for the benefit of the candidate - if you've got unlucky with one problem (or perhaps one interviewer) - you get a second chance to demonstrate that skill. 

Once the candidate demonstrates his various skills to multiple interviewers, they then meet for a debrief to make the final decision. During the meeting every interviewer has to present concrete arguments to support their suggested decision. If anyone would try to bring up something like "we didn't vibe well", such argument wouldn't fly. While this example is extreme (as in - I don't believe any of my fellow interviewers would say such a thing), I've been to more than one debrief, where one of the interviewers would highlight difficulties communicating with the candidate to a surprise of the others. Out of 5 or more people, who have interviewed the candidate, communication came up as a potential issue only to one of them. Imagine, if that person would have been the only interviewer!

An equally important reason for having long and hard interviews is giving the candidate the chance to show how good they really are. If everyone got a simple problem, that anyone can solve perfectly, what information does that give us? How could the great candidates stand out among the good ones? Or the good ones among the mediocre ones? This is the reason for multi-faceted, hard interviews. So when you receive a difficult question during your next interview, take some pride in it - that means and interviewer thinks there's a chance you could solve it at least partially and demonstrate how great you really are!

And what if you don't solve all the questions? Well, that's where levels come into play.  Don't worry, partial solution might be the expected result for your target level. 

I hope this sheds some more light on those sometimes laborious processes - they're only there to let the candidates show their full strength!

P.S. I've heard some people say, that big tech Silicon Valley companies have such difficult interviews because they have so many candidates - this is very far from the truth. While I'm not sure about the number of incoming CVs in response to job ads (someone from sourcing side of the recruitment process can comment more on that), I can tell you one thing - none of the companies I've worked for had too many candidates lined up for the interviews. Good talent is scarce everywhere.
