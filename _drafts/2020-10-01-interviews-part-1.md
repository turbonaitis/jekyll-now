Interviews and interviewing is always a hot and sometimes controversial topic. Most people find it annoying, but let me tell you, why you should enjoy the interviews and try to do them often!

I know that there are already dozens of great articles online about interviewing in general and interviewing for technical positions in particular. Still, there are so many candidates, who come unprepared (or people who don't come at all, because they're afraid), that I want to write this, in hopes that it can help more people succeed!
 
## Interviewing is the only way to get hired
If you want to get a new job (and you should be in general open to new opportunities, unless you've just joined your current company AND you're loving it), the reality is, that you have to interview. There's no other way around it. Sure, sometimes your old friend from college will just offer you a job because he/she likes you, but these don't happen often and they never happen at top companies - regardless of how much someone adores your skills and experience - you'll have to demonstrate those during the interview process first. So, interviews are inevitable, unless you're planning to retire with your current employer (or stay jobless, when your current employer lays you off). So, if you'll have to do them, why not do them well? (and perhaps enjoy them just a little bit?)
 
## Interviewing is a skill
You might be at the top of your profession, but unless you're also a celebrity - your employer-to-be does not know that. The interview process is there so that you can showcase your skills and experience and prove that you're indeed the best candidate to get the job done. Demonstrating that experience and skill is very different from actually performing the work, especially for people who are in professions, where you don't necessarily have to talk to humans daily. Even if you're in sales, selling yourself might be very different from selling whatever you're selling daily.
 
### Practice it!
Like any other skill, to be good at interviewing, you have to practice it. The practicing bit comes in two parts:
* You have to go to the actual interviews. If you haven't been in an interview for 5 years, chances are you are not going to shine there.
* Before you go to an actual interview, if you want to have higher chances of success - you have to practice before it.
 
As an interviewer, I see a lot of people fail during the interview day simply because they're not prepared - they don't know what questions to expect, they don't know the answers to those questions, they don't know what the interviewer is expecting from them and then they're getting stressed. Most often, such interviews don't end well.
 
That's why it's very important to come prepared for all these:
1. A lot of big companies send the candidate a preparation email, which outlines what questions to expect. Read them carefully. Even if there's no such email - google "Company X interview questions for my profession" or "top interview questions for the profession". You'll be surprised how much info is on the internet, despite all the NDAs, etc. Of course, most likely you won't get a question like that during your interview (and if you do get a question you know - it's probably best to tell that to your interviewer straight away - if they're calibrated - they'll know, that you've solved this problem recently). Despite that, you'll know what topics to expect and won't be caught off-guard. This also applies to the soft-skill interviews!
2. Now, that you know how the questions will look like, you have to get yourself ready to give the answers! For technical problems - practice makes perfect. Go to leetcode.com or hackerrank.com and you'll find many problems, easy and hard, waiting to be solved. Start with the easy ones, but if you're aiming for a senior position - you have to crack the hard ones as well. If the easy ones seem too easy for you - focus on speed and accuracy - aim to create a working solution on your first try as soon as possible. If the hard ones seem impossible - read about the topic and the problem and more than likely you'll find a way to solve them. This is the best part about preparation for a technical interview - even if you don't get the job, you'll still learn new things (or at least renew your forgotten knowledge) in the process. This applies to soft questions too! If you think you'll get questions like "Tell me about a time when you did X", you can improve your chances significantly by thinking of these examples in advance. Then ask a friend to ask you those questions. If you film the process and then watch it - that's even better.
3. Try to understand what the interviewer is expecting from you. For example, during the coding interviews, some companies (or even some interviewers) demand working, compilable code first and foremost and only then want to go into optimizations, others are fine with pseudo-code and focus more on demonstrating the knowledge and creating an optimal solution. Sometimes this information is provided to you by the recruitment team in advance, but if you do have any doubts - it's best to ask your interviewer. In general, the ability to ask questions (and to incorporate the answers in your solution!) is something that is desired of the candidates - so it's ALWAYS better to ask than to assume. If you chose to assume something - state that assumption explicitly. In general, 99% of interviewers are well intended - they want you to show your best self and succeed (the remaining 1% should not be allowed anywhere close to the candidates).
4. Everyone is at least a little bit stressed during an interview and a little stress is good for us - it gets us focused. Too much stress though can destroy your performance and that's why you need to learn to stress as little as you can. Stress management is a wide topic, which I'm unable to cover here, but during your interview, know that the interviewers are well intended and want you to succeed. That should help at least a bit :)
 
Now, the above list might seem a bit long - that's why you should schedule your interviews to give yourself time to prepare. Once you've sharpened your skills though, try to do a few things:
* Schedule several interviews in the same period. Not only will this allow you to prepare once and then interview several times while fresh, but this will also allow you to get a much better deal in the end. You can compare several offers, pit them against each other, and have a better feeling, which offer is good. Negotiation though is a topic for another time.
* Try to interview once a year, not once a decade. This helps you keep your interviewing skills fresh (so you'll have to spend less time preparing) and also will make interviews feel more normal - by which I mean - much less stressful.
 
## Interviewing is a way to get to know the world around you
Even if you would not change your job for any other, interviewing is still useful beyond just practicing your skills. It's a way to know more about what companies are looking for talent in your area. For what kind of work. What skills are they looking for? There's also no better way to know how their interview process looks like. And in addition to all this - you don't know how much someone is willing to pay for your work unless you have an offer on the table. The offer is twice what you earn today? Maybe it's time to move. No one is willing to pay more than half of what you're earning right now? Feel more grateful for what you have. You win either way.
 
## Interviewing is a way to get your skills validated
Once you (finally) get an offer from your dream company, even if you decide to not take it, you'll know, that you've proved to them, that you're great. If you always knew that you're the best - congratulations, that wasn't megalomania. If, as it's often the case, you're suffering from imposter syndrome - well, if someone is giving you a job offer after a hard and long interview process - perhaps you're quite good at what you do after all.
 
If you get rejected, that can be a reality check as well. Perhaps you're not AS good as you were thinking. Perhaps you didn't spend enough time preparing. Before I got my first offer from a top tech company (Uber), I was rejected by Amazon more than once. It's because of these failures at Amazon, that I was able to pass the interview at Uber - I got familiar with the interview process, I got a reality check about my skills, and knew that whatever I do daily is not enough - and so I have to prepare.
 
## Please, do apply
Some people decide to not apply to positions, that they don't think they're good enough for. While this may be true, don't be your own judge - the cost of applying is usually quite low (how hard is it to send your CV?). If you were right - you lose nothing, but if you get invited to an interview - maybe you were wrong. As per the previous section, even if it doesn't go well during the interview day, you can still learn valuable lessons in the process and improve your chances next time.
 
So regardless of how it goes on the interview day, please go and interview!
