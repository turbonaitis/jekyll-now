In this third post of the interviewing series, after [encouraging you to prepare for an interview]({% post_url 2020-10-05-interviews-part-2 %}), I'd like to touch upon one more way to get better during the interviews - becoming an interviewer yourself!

## Why?
There are several reasons to become an interviewer yourself. First of all, you'll be helping your company hire the right talent. Someone has to do the interviews and while culture/behavioral interviews might be run by HR in some companies, the technical interviews have to be run by someone with skills that are being tested. Stepping forward and volunteering to be an interviewer is the right thing to do and doing the right thing will not only feel good but might be beneficial to your career.

It also very likely is a different kind of work to what you're doing regularly, so it might be a nice change of pace and can be a great opportunity at practicing a different set of skills (talking to people?). As a bonus, you're also likely to interact with people from outside your direct team, which gives you a good opportunity to broaden your social network in the company. 

Last, but not least, it's a great way to get better at interviewing as a candidate. When interviewing others, you'll get a much better understanding of how the interviewers think, what goals they have and what they may expect of the candidate (although, as mentioned in the previous post - these expectations might differ between companies). In addition to that, you'll see many candidates answering your questions, which will give you insights not only into various mistakes, that can be made, but much more importantly, will show you many ways of approaching the same problem. This is especially true for more open-ended problems, like the ones presented during software architecture interviews. Finally, you'll have to be able to evaluate the solutions, that candidates create - as a result, you'll be in a much better position, when looking for flaws in your solutions as a candidate.

## How?
Companies that are actively looking for best talent usually are short on interviewers, so if you'll express your interest in becoming one, you're more than likely to get the support from the organisation for your ambitions. The exact path to becoming an interviewer differs between companies, so it's best to ask someone, who is already part of the interview process there. 

Usually, you'll have to complete some internal training, as there are regulations about what you shouldn't do during the interview. Most of this comes from non-discrimination laws and while some of those are obvious, others might be less so. A quick test - as part of your small talk before or after the actual interview, can you ask the candidate how far did he have to travel to your office? If you think you can - you're quite likely wrong (of course, this depends on the country you're in). 

In larger organisations, the next step is watching someone experienced interview the candidate and then discuss what happened. Once you do that (maybe a couple of times), you'll be ready to interview your first candidate (the process is more complicated in really big companies, but let's try and keep this simple). Then you'll see, that the interviewer might also be nervous, not just the candidate :)

Now, that you know both the advantages of being an interviewer and how to become one, I highly recommend trying it out! 

Have you ever interviewed candidates yourself? What's the hardest part?
